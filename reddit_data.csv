The state of multiplayer games has never been so bad.,Heyvus,600,383,"['I remember playing on Foundation in Halo 2 and the whole team leaves except one guy and you just wait for him to respawn and find him.  As the last guy I always went down with honor throwing frags and trying to take one with me per life.\n\nI have experienced more entire teams leaving.  I think a big issue is not having the lobby be retained.  It was always kind of fun playing with the same 8 or so people game to game in COD, seeing who did better when, seeing who could beat who on what map.  Now the only real time you develop that ""relationship"" is if you happen to match with them game to game.\n\nThis was done I\'m sure to limit hostility and toxicity but I do think it lowers engagement in a way and causes more leavers.', 'It\'s been like that for a while. I used to play a lot of online Madden back in the 2000s when it was still on PC. Everybody was generally running teams that had a mobile QB or a ""cheat code"" WR. But I played with the very average Panthers, and I played actual football. I ran the ball, ran clock, used PA effectively, and knew how to play LB and S on defense. It wasn\'t rocket science, but I had like a 70+% win rate and probably half of that came from games where I\'d run nearly a whole quarter down on a TD drive and either force a turnover or a 3 and out on their first offensive drive, and they\'d just quit and send me super angry messages about how I wasn\'t playing right.', 'When there is no penalty for disrupting games but there are for calling these assholes out.\n\nThis is what happens.', ""I think a lot of it has to do with the trend of persistent stat tracking in online games. If you lost a game back in 2005, the next game was a clean slate. If you lose a game today, that loss is on your record for life.\n\nIt's a lot harder for people to focus on having fun instead of winning when they know every failure leaves a permanent black mark on their account. Throw in things like clans requiring members to maintain a minimum W/L ratio and it only gets worse.\n\nI still think TF2 did it the best. It tracked and told you all your greatest achievements but never your worst. For example, it told you the most kills you got in 1 life instead of your average K/D ratio. That way, new bests felt good, but a bad match never really felt bad. You knew the next round was a chance to win again.\n\nI would also say random match makers instead of community ran servers plays a part. You used to be friends with other server regulars on both teams. Now you only know the 2-4 players in your matchmaking squad. Easier to care about being a good sport when you know the people you are playing against."", 'The OW community is extremely bad with this. I‚Äôve had teams rage quit after my team won a single fight, even though they‚Äôd been winning up until then. It‚Äôs part of the game culture now and I hate it.', 'Did I hear a rock and stone?', '[removed]', 'yeah multiplayer games are definitely a late stage product at this point, meta gaming has completely taken over the genre and people play their multiplayer games based on which meta sounds most fun to exploit or easiest to exploit, the companies only make them to farm cash from kids, nobody is having fun only trying to grind out a twitch career. multiplayer games have become content sweatshops and casinos where you buy custom assets for 20 dollars that can‚Äôt even be used between games on the same engine it‚Äôs chill', 'My husband complains about this endlessly with LOL now. He said his team will just give up the first moment something doesn‚Äôt go their way. Super annoying.', 'Or worse than having them all rage quit, actively sabotaging the game because ‚Äúthe enemy got the first kill/objective/etc. we shouldn‚Äôt even bother trying now‚Äù **Then** I get yelled at by all of my ‚Äúteammates‚Äù because I have the audacity to try and win, and refuse to abandon all hope over something insignificant.', 'I‚Äôm 35 and I just don‚Äôt play pvp games anymore. I‚Äôll do crucible in destiny for a quest or whatever but if I‚Äôm just playing or grinding stuff out I stay well clear.', ""I don't know.  People threw controllers through TVs, punched holes in walls and started physical altercations over multiplayer videogames even in the 80s.  People have always been bad sports.  It's just more and more people game and communication is easier than ever and so is getting in and out of games.  People were less likely to rage quit when connecting and getting a stable game was a bigger ordeal."", ""I stopped playing multiplayer garbage like 15 years ago.

Good times. Good games.', ""Battle Royale games are notorious with this, even when they have modes with respawns as opposed to the normal: \n\nOne life, if you want another one your teammates have to step up \n\nRule they carry. \n\nI feel like in the last 5 years it has exploded. I pop up on Fortnite/Apex every once in a while and join squads. I have a single teammate in my 4-man team get knocked. They leave instantly. All of the rest of us could have full health/shields/etc. It doesn't matter. \n\nA lot of younger players have entered the scenes of games like these. The couple most recent generations of kids have been conditioned with this concept of instant gratification.\n\nIf they fail once, it doesn't matter if there's somehow a second chance - they're out for that attempt because they have zero patience and can't wait a few seconds to see how their team manages to deal with the situation."", 'Bad players give up, good players recover.', 'I thought it‚Äôs just me and that i am getting old.  ü§£\n\nThings changed quiet a bit last years or decade you really can tell. Maybe that was the golden era of online gaming, idk.\n\nIf you‚Äôre not willing to lose you are not able to learn to a certain degree. \nOf course wins are good for the ego but those experiences of losing can help you become better with tactics and so on.\n\nI‚Äôm playing an online open world survival game for a while. Lost a week old character (30h in game) to a stupid gun fight we could have had avoided if we made a different decision.\nYeah it sucks but i honestly enjoyed starting over with a new character more than constantly being worried to lose my progress.\n\nI enjoy this way more than all those years of sweating in domination/conquest as mostly only one on the enemy flag. For me it was that K/D over win mind set that killed it for me personally.', 'I stopped playing MMOs for a while after WoW. Recently picked up Elder Scrolls Online and was really surprised how mostly nice and helpful the community is.', 'Yeah that‚Äôs why I stopped playing Apex about a year ago. My friends moved on from the game and so I had to play with randoms who would drop by themselves and quit the game as soon as they went down. It‚Äôs like all these people don‚Äôt know that Apex is meant to be a team based game. \n\nThe worst is the players who start bitching and screaming because someone selected their main before them.

I don't want to deal with people."", 'Competitive ranking ladders ruined multiplayer. \n\nIt stopped being about having fun and became being about climbing the ladder. \n\nBattle pass style progression systems have just made it worse by making winning the only way to consistently and effectively make progress.', 'Competitive is cancer.', 'If you play fifa you know how bad it is. 4/5 games won‚Äôt reach the full 90 mins.', ""I think a big problem is alot of games have stripped away alot of the fun and/or meaningful progression and so now winning is all that's left. In OW I used to get lootboxes and unlock fun skins and try to collect everything. Now in Overwatch 2 all that fun stuff is gone and all that's left is winning."", ""Having the option to surrender in most games on unranked mode is just an absolute travesty. \n\nOn ranked, at least players are most likely to give it their all until the other team totally kills them because players will want to avoid loss if there's even the slightest chance of a comeback to avoid losing ranked points\n\nOn casuals though, it's just a nightmare to have in the game. The moment people see they're not playing from ahead they just give up and afk, hitting surrender at every opportunity until it succeeds. \n\nFor someone like me who enjoys going for a comeback victory, but doesn't like the try-hard stress inducing atmosphere of ranked, I'm basically just ostracized from any competitive game that has a surrender button because I'll want to play from behind and either my team will leave or they'll just give up trying the moment they lose the lead, so I just straight up can't play the way I want to half the time. \n\nGames like Dota got it right where you can't surrender, and the game puts you in the garbage matchmaking pool if you go afk, feed, or leave."", 'This aint a new thing', 'As a 42 year old gamer I call rubbish.', ""It's not multiplayer games, it's the players.

Basic approach is take a sample of chat comments.  Have a set of people go through a sampling of the comments, at least 2 or 3 people per comment to make it less arbitrary, and label them as toxic or not toxic.  Take unusual words and phrases from that list and build a brute-force filter that bans them.  Get more sophisticated by training a supervised model (several approaches depending on how much money you want to spent, false positives / negatives / etc) to detect them.  This can result in a model that can not only tag toxic comments, but, if you have a system for players to also tag toxic comments, then regularly retrain/rebuild the model, will fairly quickly also tag peoples\' attempts to work around the system (i.e. ""Let\'s Go Brandon"" type coded speech should quickly get subsumed into the model after it becomes popular enough for people to recognize it as toxic).\n\nThe above is a fairly cookie cutter approach that dates as early as the first email spam filters, and has gotten tremendously more accurate and sophisticated over time.

Confirmation bias will mean that if someone AFK\'s at the wrong time, they\'ll get declared intentional by fellow players.  If people claim someone did an intentional AFK as often as, in my experience, they claim someone is a cheater, there will be a ton of incorrect player-generated labels to go through.  Labeling AFK\'s as intentional seems labor intensive because people with decent expertise in the game would need to review a decent amount of actual footage to confirm.  Building a model that can look at overall game telemetry and detect or at least flag when an intentional afk has happened is theoretically possible, assuming the relative movements of the players and the state of the game, balanced against the likelihood that someone just randomly AFK\'d, might lead to a high likelihood that an intentional AFK took place. \n\nThere might be shortcuts, for example I\'d imagine that as the game reaches a climax scoring or timing wise, or when the game begins, the number of intentional afk\'s will go up.  And I imagine that someone who exhibits an unusual number of afk scenarios during games would have a higher chance of being someone who is doing it intentionally.

Then the game is just not fun. They code the cars so that they run into you more than normal in missions where if you get hit you lose money. That's literally been found in the code at the game and not a debatable thing. All you have to do is have to understand how to read that code and you see it right there in front of you. Not only that but missions where you're supposed to be trying to make money from spending the millions of money that you grinded hours and literally weeks worth of your time in real life... Only to have to save all of that money so that you can buy these businesses and do incredibly annoying missions where you're driving across the map getting blown up by players or run into by the AI of the game and just overall making it as annoying and cumbersome as possible to make what is essentially pennies in that game. $1,000,000 might as well just be a dollar within it. Trust me I have tons of stuff online that I bought with shark cards when I was young and dumb and didn't think about it because of how frustrating it was to make money especially at that time. At that time there were no heist or anything like that and the only real way to make anything above $5,000 is a race. The best races used to give you for years and years when that game first came out was maybe 10,000 to 20,000... I spent $1,000 real-life dollars in that game and still don't have all the cool cars that you really want. I bought all those businesses and most of them don't make jack shit and the only one worth it is the nightclub and all the other businesses that you have to buy to go along with it which I also have. It's just the missions are absolute hell to do solo. Not everybody has friends who has a console. If you go off and say well why don't you play on PC I'll ask you why don't you play on console. Not everybody has infinite money in real life to be able to buy a PC that can handle GTA online. Not only that but I prefer the feel of a controller over a keyboard. It's my preference and I shouldn't be punished for wanting to play solo. I just like playing that way myself anyway. In GTA I don't run around killing people like everybody else and rather enjoy making temporary friends and small interactions in the game and not ruining everyone's day. I literally drop off my vehicles to people and let them play with them and have fun because it gives me joy. That's the kind of player I am. I'm a good person and I don't do anything that is deserving of a cargo bob having near infinite Mass and being impossible to stop without coming to an incredibly slow crawl to get to the destination to drop off a shipment for my business while being attacked by players or have to take a huge cut by going into a solo lobby. Or even if that isn't the case and all the players are being nice and leaving me alone I still have to deal with the way that cargo Bob flies with such a huge load and for some reason having to drive halfway across the entire map just to get to it in the first place. I mean it's a helicopter Why didn't I pick up the load at my nightclub with the helicopter and take it with it. Why did I drive across the map to get into a helicopter?? Literally makes no sense and is just designed to be as cumbersome frustrating and annoying and give players as much time as possible to grief you as possible. I have all of the fun vehicles in the game but the game itself isn't fun. That's the problem. The core mechanics to make money suck and are really annoying for anyone playing even with friends. It literally takes days for my warehouse to fill up unless I run individual missions myself and even then it'll still take hours and hours and hours of grinding. Just to make a million dollars which won't even buy me a car worth anything. I'd have to do that several times over just to have enough to buy one vehicle. To buy the oppressor at the discounted price is $6 million. That's insane to grind that money even through a business. Taking several days just to get one vehicle. Not only that but the cost that it took to get those businesses in the first place. That's beyond broken that's greedy on their part to make it as annoying as they can and is cumbersome as they can so you just say fuck it I've already bought the game so I guess I'll buy a shark card. I mean what's the point in having a $60 game that takes up so much space on your console that's no fun to play with unless you have some fun vehicles. so you either pay the price of the shark cards or realize what you're getting into before you get into it and quit there.

But that doesn't mean that the overall general feeling of the community is that rock star is incredibly greedy and their money missions are designed to be as irritating as possible. Which them being as irritating as they are is partial proof for their greed. It is that greed that will ultimately kill their company or at least very severely hurt their bottom dollar. Companies which show themselves as nothing but money grabbing whores generally end up treated as such. I guarantee you that if their behavior continues we will see a very huge decline and not only game purchases but also in game purchases. Nearly $100 in life real dollars for a measly 8 million is nothing but greed. You could only buy one oppressor Mark 2 with that price. It is 8 million on its own. And sure you can get a cheaper price by doing the missions for it but you not only need a terabyte to do that but also be registered as a CEO of some company. All of that will come out too far more than 8 million. so overall If all you really wanting is the oppressor all that other money to get it to cost 6 would inevitably make it cost a shitload more than just 6 million. Most upgrades for anything are near 100,000 if not several hundred thousand dollars. If you do not see rock stars greed then you either are simply not looking. Or you don't want to see it. Those that see it hate them for it. That is your proof of decline. There are entire subreddits dedicated to how greedy rock star is. These are not just opinions they are objective fact at this point. No company who isn't just greedy does the kinds of things they do. They just don't."", 'That I agree with.

AFKs are easy as well but trolls and to some degree bots are much harder for an automated system', 'Toxic language detection is straightforward and gets more straightforward with each passing day as language models get better.  Basic approach is take a sample of chat comments.  Have a set of people go through a sampling of the comments, at least 2 or 3 people per comment to make it less arbitrary, and label them as toxic or not toxic.  Take unusual words and phrases from that list and build a brute-force filter that bans them.  Get more sophisticated by training a supervised model (several approaches depending on how much money you want to spent, false positives / negatives / etc) to detect them.  This can result in a model that can not only tag toxic comments, but, if you have a system for players to also tag toxic comments, then regularly retrain/rebuild the model, will fairly quickly also tag peoples\' attempts to work around the system (i.e. ""Let\'s Go Brandon"" type coded speech should quickly get subsumed into the model after it becomes popular enough for people to recognize it as toxic).\n\nThe above is a fairly cookie cutter approach that dates as early as the first email spam filters, and has gotten tremendously more accurate and sophisticated over time.  It isn\'t easy, because of the sheer volume of chat messages and the multi lingual ecosystem, but it\'s far easier than it was.\n\nIntentional AFK, at least to me, seems much trickier.  Confirmation bias will mean that if someone AFK\'s at the wrong time, they\'ll get declared intentional by fellow players.  If people claim someone did an intentional AFK as often as, in my experience, they claim someone is a cheater, there will be a ton of incorrect player-generated labels to go through.  Labeling AFK\'s as intentional seems labor intensive because people with decent expertise in the game would need to review a decent amount of actual footage to confirm.  Building a model that can look at overall game telemetry and detect or at least flag when an intentional afk has happened is theoretically possible, assuming the relative movements of the players and the state of the game, balanced against the likelihood that someone just randomly AFK\'d, might lead to a high likelihood that an intentional AFK took place. \n\nThere might be shortcuts, for example I\'d imagine that as the game reaches a climax scoring or timing wise, or when the game begins, the number of intentional afk\'s will go up.  And I imagine that someone who exhibits an unusual number of afk scenarios during games would have a higher chance of being someone who is doing it intentionally.  But that\'s all supposition on my part, I\'ve made what I thought were way better theories when it comes to user behavior and been completely wrong, or found some other confounding variable that makes it impossible to measure in the first place...\n\nI\'m sure people are working on that stuff, I know of similar approaches in other fields (labeling timeseries telemetry based on learned patterns), but much less of a solved problem than toxic language.', 'Going 1/5 isnt an issue anyone cares about really, but seeing a lane have 20 deaths at 20 minutes should be bannable, also dying that much every 2-3 games in anything above gold elo should be near perma banned (rank only, you can die in normals trying builds and champs or whatever). also if a solo laner dies 20 times he will get reportef by all 9 players, however if the bot lane has 1 death per minute somehow its excusable? even if the deaths are split amongst 2 people its still a lane. dying 20 times is pure griefing after the 2nd death you play safe and farm, respect range etc.', 'Titania EX face fucked my friends and I for three hours.

I bought all those businesses and most of them don't make jack shit and the only one worth it is the nightclub and all the other businesses that you have to buy to go along with it which I also have. It's just the missions are absolute hell to do solo. Not everybody has friends who has a console. If you go off and say well why don't you play on PC I'll ask you why don't you play on console. Not everybody has infinite money in real life to be able to buy a PC that can handle GTA online. Not only that but I prefer the feel of a controller over a keyboard. It's my preference and I shouldn't be punished for wanting to play solo. I just like playing that way myself anyway. In GTA I don't run around killing people like everybody else and rather enjoy making temporary friends and small interactions in the game and not ruining everyone's day. I literally drop off my vehicles to people and let them play with them and have fun because it gives me joy. That's the kind of player I am. I'm a good person and I don't do anything that is deserving of a cargo bob having near infinite Mass and being impossible to stop without coming to an incredibly slow crawl to get to the destination to drop off a shipment for my business while being attacked by players or have to take a huge cut by going into a solo lobby. Or even if that isn't the case and all the players are being nice and leaving me alone I still have to deal with the way that cargo Bob flies with such a huge load and for some reason having to drive halfway across the entire map just to get to it in the first place. I mean it's a helicopter Why didn't I pick up the load at my nightclub with the helicopter and take it with it. Why did I drive across the map to get into a helicopter?? Literally makes no sense and is just designed to be as cumbersome frustrating and annoying and give players as much time as possible to grief you as possible. I have all of the fun vehicles in the game but the game itself isn't fun. That's the problem. The core mechanics to make money suck and are really annoying for anyone playing even with friends. It literally takes days for my warehouse to fill up unless I run individual missions myself and even then it'll still take hours and hours and hours of grinding. Just to make a million dollars which won't even buy me a car worth anything. I'd have to do that several times over just to have enough to buy one vehicle. To buy the oppressor at the discounted price is $6 million. That's insane to grind that money even through a business. Taking several days just to get one vehicle. Not only that but the cost that it took to get those businesses in the first place. That's beyond broken that's greedy on their part to make it as annoying as they can and is cumbersome as they can so you just say fuck it I've already bought the game so I guess I'll buy a shark card. I mean what's the point in having a $60 game that takes up so much space on your console that's no fun to play with unless you have some fun vehicles. so you either pay the price of the shark cards or realize what you're getting into before you get into it and quit there.

Name something that lasts forever. Go ahead. About the only thing that I can come up that lasts forever is maybe matter. But here's the thing matter will constantly transform states and become something else before it returns to what it was. So perhaps technically things last forever but not in the state that they were once in. That we can be certain of. Anytime we look into anything ever it always ends at some point even if it returns back to where it was. Whether it be macrophysics quantum physics or any arbitrary human expression or experience has different phases that it goes through.

It is fairly reasonable to say that Rockstar won't last forever. It is fairly reasonable to say that Disney won't last forever or any other company that you list for that matter. How America and all other countries won't last forever if history tells us anything. The US is only been a country for a few hundred years and that is a tiny amount of time in comparison to the birth and death of most countries. So sure the US might live for another thousand years but that'll be it. Eventually everything has its day and it's Eve. Maybe one day it will return to how it was before but with companies and countries and things like that they typically don't. That's just what history says and not any one person.

But that doesn't mean that the overall general feeling of the community is that rock star is incredibly greedy and their money missions are designed to be as irritating as possible. Which them being as irritating as they are is partial proof for their greed. It is that greed that will ultimately kill their company or at least very severely hurt their bottom dollar. Companies which show themselves as nothing but money grabbing whores generally end up treated as such. I guarantee you that if their behavior continues we will see a very huge decline and not only game purchases but also in game purchases. Nearly $100 in life real dollars for a measly 8 million is nothing but greed. You could only buy one oppressor Mark 2 with that price. It is 8 million on its own. And sure you can get a cheaper price by doing the missions for it but you not only need a terabyte to do that but also be registered as a CEO of some company. All of that will come out too far more than 8 million. so overall If all you really wanting is the oppressor all that other money to get it to cost 6 would inevitably make it cost a shitload more than just 6 million. Most upgrades for anything are near 100,000 if not several hundred thousand dollars. If you do not see rock stars greed then you either are simply not looking. Or you don't want to see it. Those that see it hate them for it. That is your proof of decline. There are entire subreddits dedicated to how greedy rock star is. These are not just opinions they are objective fact at this point. No company who isn't just greedy does the kinds of things they do. They just don't."", 'That I agree with.

Totally get that, i played Outriders with a friend and i wasn't in it because i loved the game, i just liked to mess around with my friend and laugh!"", '[deleted]', 'It really depends on the game and/or people.\n\nI am not against to playing co-op, but it is far from the same thing as playing solo ""but more fun cuz people"". I\'ve heard many people say stuff like this ""gaming is just more fun with other people"". No, it\'s not, not always anyway. It definitely can be for certain games or with certain people, but sometime just playing a game alone is better\n\nHere\'s a list of things I will never experience in a solo game\n\n-other player being stronger than I am killing everything before I can get to it\n\n-other player being weaker than I am and dying every 5 seconds\n\n-waiting 20 minutes for other player to sort through their loot to see what gear is best while I just sit there ready to go\n\n-other playing not caring about collectibles/secrets/puzzles/etc and just makes a beeline for the end of the level\n\n-that one idiot who never turns down their shitty music/is constantly fighting with their SO/has the baby crying in the background\n\n-having to hold up a conversation\n\nI have a group of friends ill jump into coop games with on occasion and sometimes it\'s fun, but even in my group of friends we still run into some of the above issues.\n\nYes, gaming with friends can be fun, but to state that multi-player is always better than single player because ""more people = more fun"" like it\'s a fact is just asinine', 'Yep.  I am so fucking glad the multiplayer games I play include a block/blacklist function']"
